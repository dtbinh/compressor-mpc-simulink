\section{Thesis Overview}
\label{sec:intro:overview}

This work is organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item An overview of previous work done in the field and other relevant literature is presented in \sect{lit}.
  \item The dynamic compressor model used both for simulation and by the MPC controller is detailed in \sect{modelling}.
  \item \sect{mpc} gives a brief development of the underlying optimization performed by the MPC controller, and the steps that are taken at each iteration to obtain the next input to apply to the system.
  \item The results of the simulation tests as well as a comparison between the distributed and centralized model predictive controllers are shown in \sect{results}.
\end{itemize}
