\section{Thesis Overview}
\label{sec:intro:overview}

This Master's thesis is organized as follows:

\begin{itemize}
  \item An overview of modelling approaches for centrifugal compressors, current state-of-the-art control schemes and recent research in the field is given in \sect{lit}.
  \item The dynamic compressor model used both for simulation and by the MPC controller is detailed in \sect{modelling}.
  \item \sect{mpc} gives a brief development of the underlying optimization performed by the MPC controller, and the steps that are taken at each iteration to obtain the next input to apply to the system.
  \item The results of the simulation tests as well as a comparison between the distributed and centralized model predictive controllers are shown and discussed in \sect{results}.
\end{itemize}
