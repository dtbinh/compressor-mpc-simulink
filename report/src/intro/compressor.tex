\section{Compressor Control}
\label{sec:intro:compressor}

Compressor control generally consists of two separate, sometimes competing tasks: process control and anti-surge control.
Process control seeks primarily to regulate an output variable of the compressor -- in this report, the output pressure is used, but mass flow or other variables could equally be chosen.
The manipulated variable used in process control varies depending on the type of compressor studied.
Gas turbine-driven compressors, for example, may have a valve regulating the fuel flow to the turbine, which can be adjusted by the control system to increase or decrease the compressor speed. 
For the electric, variable-speed drivers considered here, the manipulated variable is the torque applied by the driver to the compressor, which is adjusted to maintain the output pressure at the desired setpoint.
A diagram of a sample compressor is shown in \fig{mod:single-comp}.

Anti-surge control keeps the compressor away from an unstable regime known as surge, which is characterized by unstable oscillations in the mass flow rate through the compressor.
Surge occurs when the load on the compressor increases, resulting in a reduced and then oscillatory mass flow.
In extreme cases (known as ``deep surge'') the mass flow can actually become negative.
Operating in the surge regime can cause serious damage to the compressor.

The conditions leading to surge are determined experimentally and plotted as a line on the compressor map, known as the surge line (SL).
\footnote{The transition to surge only collapses onto a single line in the compressor map if (quasi\babelhyphen{nobreak})invariant coordinates are used; the transition to surge is then invariant to the inlet conditions. 
For a detailed discussion of compressor maps and invariant coordinate systems, see \cite{Batson1996}.
For the purposes of this work, the pressure ratio and mass flow rate are used and are assumed to be quasi-invariant for the cases studied.}
This plot is then used to define a surge distance (\g{sd}) for the compressor, which is defined as the horizontal distance between the current operating point and the surge line.
\footnote{The surge distance is sometimes also defined as the angular distance between the operating point and the surge line.}
To avoid entering the surge regime, a surge control line (SCL) that is offset from the surge line, and a corresponding surge control distance (\g{scd}) are defined to add a safety margin for the controller.
The controller should maintain the operating point to the right of the surge control line.
A compressor map with the surge line and surge distance labeled is shown in \fig{intro:comp-map}.

Although the surge regime should be avoided during compressor operation, often the most efficient operating points (and thus the operating points used in industrial applications) are on or near the surge control line.
If the compressor enters surge, however, it often triggers a costly shutdown of the system to prevent damaging the machinery.
The anti-surge controller is therefore crucial in allowing the compressor to maximize efficiency by operating near the surge line, while still rejecting disturbances quickly enough to avoid entering the surge regime.

Surge is avoided primarily through the use of a recycle valve, which can be opened to allow flow from the discharge to the suction tank of the compressor.
This simultaneously reduces the discharge pressure and increases the mass flow through the compressor, moving the operating point down and to the right on the compressor map -- away from surge.
For compressors with electric drivers, the torque input to the driver can also be used to rapidly increase the mass flow through the compressor, thereby temporarily increasing the surge distance.
