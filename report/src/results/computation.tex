\section{Computational Efficiency}
\label{sec:results:computation}

The computational cost of the centralized and distributed control approaches was evaluated and is presented in \fig{results:compcost}.
The computation times for the distributed controllers assume a parallelized implementation where each sub-controller is executed using a separate processor. 

As expected, the non-cooperative controller achieves the lowest computation times for both the parallel and the serial system.
In both cases, the cooperative controller has a computation time approximately on par with the centralized controller, though slightly lower for few solver iterations.

It should be noted that performance gains for solver iterations greater than 2 are marginal. Disturbance (described in \sect{results:performance}) is applied at \u{50}{s} and total simulation time is \u{500}{s}.}
