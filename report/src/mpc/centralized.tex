\section{Centralized Control Approach}
\label{sec:mpc:centralized}

In the centralized control approach, a single MPC controller is used to optimize for all system inputs using a single cost function, defined in \sect{mpc:cost-function}.
At each sampling period, the optimal input is computed using the following algorithm:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item perform estimation to obtain the augmented state (see Section~\ref{sec:mpc:estimation});
  \item linearize, discretize and augment non-linear model about the current state estimate and previous inputs, as described in Section~\ref{sec:mpc:linearization};
  \item generate the prediction matrices using \eqref{eq:mpc:augmented-state-eqs};
  \item set up the QP problem according to \eqref{eq:mpc:optimization-qp-formulation} and solve using the \qpoases{} solver;
  \item apply the optimal input at the first prediction interval to the system.
\end{enumerate}

For both the parallel and serial compressor systems, the centralized controller solves for 4 inputs (2 per compressor).
