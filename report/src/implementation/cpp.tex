\section{C++ Implementation}

For use on embedded systems, and for a more accurate characterization of the computational efficiency of each controller, the controllers were also implemented and tested in C++ using the qpOASES library presented in \cite{Ferreau2014} to solve quadratic programs, and the Eigen\cite{Eigen} C++ library to perform linear algebra calculations.


One of the advantages of the C++ implementation compared to that in Simulink is that is able to use knowledge of the augmented model structure to multiply the augmented matrices ($A\ut{aug}$, $B\ut{aug}$ and $C\ut{aug}$) more efficiently.
