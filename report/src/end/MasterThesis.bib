The model of the compression system includes a main process line with the compressor and a recycle line with the antisurge recycle valve. Different disturbance and control tuning scenarios were tested and the response of the model predictive controller was analysed, evaluated and also compared with a traditional control system. Temperature effects have been taken into account in the model of the process and in the constraint formulation of the MPC optimization problem.

abstract = {The present work concerns model predictive control (MPC) of centrifugal gas compressors and describes the development of an MPC application for the tasks of anti-surge and process control. More specifically, the MPC formulation focuses on the question of how the transient manipulation of driver torque can be used to improve the performance of anti-surge and process control. For the purpose of testing and validating the proposed control algorithm, an experimental compressor test rig is presented, which is designed to mimic a typical centrifugal compressor application in the oil and gas industry. Modeling and parameter identification of the experimental setup is followed by the realization of the MPC solution on an embedded system to comply with the stringent real-time requirements for anti-surge control. Testing is performed with experiments using suction and discharge side disturbances, which are created by rapid valve closures. For comparison the same tests are repeated with conventional control approaches. The test results indicate improvements in maintaining the distance to surge by up to 11{\%}, while at the same time reducing the process control settling time by up to 50{\%}.},

One relatively$\backslash$nrecent approach to solve QP problems are parametric active-set methods that$\backslash$nare based on tracing the solution along a linear homotopy between a QP$\backslash$nproblem with known solution and the QP problem to be solved.

In this paper we describe the open-source C++ software$\backslash$npackage {\{}$\backslash$tt qpOASES{\}}, which implements a parametric active-set method in a$\backslash$nreliable and efficient way.

The experimental work was focused on the measurement of compressor behaviour within the surge zone by means of a specifically designed facility. The presented model is based on the introduction of a fluid inertia term that accounts for the non quasi steady effects and the use of a compressor map extended to the surge and negative flows zone obtained from experimental tests. The compressor model was implemented in a one-dimensional gas-dynamic model. The comparison of the modelled and measured evolution of instantaneous pressure during deep surge operation shows good agreement. Furthermore, the model is also able to predict the amplitude and frequency of pressure pulses when the compressor operates in surge with different outlet duct lengths. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

It is shown that previous unstable operating points to the left of the surge line can be made globally exponentially stable by using the rotational speed of the motor as control. It is then shown that stability and exponential convergence to a set follows when the torque of the drive is considered to be the control input.

abstract = {Abstract The analysis of signals of surges and rotating stalls occurring and processing is essential to reveal the characteristics of instability phenomena, to develop detecting methodology and active control technique, to assure the rig and compressor safety. A high-speed 7-stage compressor was tested on a rig, with 10 channels of casing static pressures and a channel of outlet total pressure. It illustrates by the case with the rotating speed 16,400RPM. Firstly, to detect the stall precursors, the spectrum analysis and the short-time-Fourier-transform (STFT) are employed. It shows the precursors are formed about 3.5s before the surge point in each stage individually. Then, the correlation functions are calculated to analysis the relationship between casing static pressures. Results show that the rotating stalls of the 1-3stages have phase differences, while the 4-7stages do not. Finally, the time-domain waveforms analysis instruct that the stagnation cell of surge is firstly formed between the 3rdand the 4thstator rows, and then moves downwards. The surge is companied with the rotating stalls. The front 3 stages are in the cycles of the stall-surge-recover-stall in the whole surge process.},

@article{Shehata2009,
abstract = {This paper presents the application of active control of surge in constant speed centrifugal compressors based on the Moore-Greitzer (MG) model. Different controllers are developed for a compression system equipped with a close-coupled valve (CCV) and a throttle control valve (TCV). The combination of the two valves helps suppress surge and assists in overcoming the drawbacks of each valve when it is used individually. The presented controllers are evaluated based on many performance indices. Accordingly, a case-based variable structure controller is developed that succeeds to stabilize the system for various operating conditions and to extend the stable range well beyond the surge line. A flow extension of 76{\%} and a stable throttle level of 0.1, with substantially decreased pressure settling times, are reported. The developed controller performs significantly better compared to other nonlinear controllers, such as the backstepping controller. ?? 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

@article{Xenos2015,
abstract = {The aim of this paper is to present a methodology for optimizing the operation of compressors in parallel in process industries. Compressors in parallel can be found in many applications for example in compressor stations conveying gas through long pipelines and in chemical plants in which compressors supply raw or processed materials to downstream processes. The current work presents an optimization framework for compressor stations which describe integration of a short term and a long term optimization approach. The short-term part of the framework suggests the best distribution of the load of the compressors (where the time scale is minutes) and the long-term optimization provides the scheduling of the compressors for large time periods (where the time scale is days). The paper focuses on the short-term optimization and presents a Real Time Optimization (RTO) framework which exploits process data in steady-state operation to develop regression models of compressors. An optimization model employs the updated steady-state models to estimate the best distribution of the load of the compressors to reduce power consumption and therefore operational costs. The paper demonstrates the application of the RTO to a network of parallel industrial multi-stage centrifugal compressors, part of a chemical process in BASF SE, Germany. The results from the RTO application showed a reduction in power consumption compared to operation with equal load split strategy.},

@article{Zhou2015,
abstract = {The concept of variable geometry compressor (VGC) has been recently proposed as a future improvement for automotive turbochargers to further increase the efficiency and boosting at low engine speed, and to provide a more direct control over the stability margin at medium-high engine load. This paper presents a control design for the air path system of an automotive diesel engine equipped with exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), variable geometry turbine (VGT), and VGC systems. Starting from a validated model, a study of the steady-state and dynamic responses is conducted to understand the influence of the VGC combined with VGT-EGR actuators on the performance of the system. Then, a feedback control strategy that coordinates the VGC actuator with the existing VGT-EGR controller based on model predictive control is proposed to optimize the compressor performance. The new methodology shows how the VGC can be used to increase the stability range of the compressor while providing the opportunity to improve its efficiency, by means of shifting the surge limit and reshaping the peak efficiency region of the machine. Simulation results on a vehicle acceleration profile with gear shift transients are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},
